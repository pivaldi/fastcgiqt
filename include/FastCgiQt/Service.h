	 *
	 * urlMap() should be overridden to provide a regex->slot mapping;
	 * dispatchRequest() will call the first slot in this map with a
	 * matching regex.
	 *
	 * QString parameters to the slots are supported, as long as the number
	 * of parameters is the same as the number of captured subexpressions in
	 * expression in the map.
	 *
	 * Service subclasses should be used in conjunction with a ServiceMapper
	 * subclass, providing an easy way to map /foo/bar/baz to Foo::bar(baz)
	 * (for example).
	 *
	 * These objects are semi-persistent, in that one will be created per
	 * thread (which may be more than one request) - there is no guarantee
	 * that all requests in the same session will go to the same instance of
	 * your subclass.
	 *
	 * Service also maintains two caches:
	 *  - A file cache
	 *  - A request cache
	 *
	 * The file cache caches data from the readFile call.
	 *
	 * The request cache caches urlFragment -> result pairs. This is only
	 * used if a slot calls cacheThisRequest(). You can expire a cache
	 * entry by reimplementing isExpired.
	 *
	 * These caches are currently per-process. In the future, they may be
	 * shared between processes via memcached or similar. They default to a
	 * maximum size of 10MiB.
